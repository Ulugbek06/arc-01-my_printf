my_printf
This project is a custom implementation of the printf function in C. The my_printf function allows you to format and print text to the standard output stream with various specifiers.

# Usage 
1.Include the my_printf function in your project by copying the provided code into your source code file.
2.Call the my_printf function in your code to print formatted text.
my_printf(format_string, ...);


- `format_string`: A string containing format specifiers for the text to be printed.
- `...`: Additional arguments corresponding to the format specifiers in the `format_string`.

# Format Specifiers
The format_string can contain the following format specifiers:
%d: Print a signed decimal integer.
%c: Print a character.
%s: Print a null-terminated string.
%o: Print an octal number.
%x: Print a hexadecimal number.
%p: Print a memory address.
%u: Print an unsigned integer.
# Return Value
The my_printf function returns the total number of characters printed.
# Supported Features
The my_printf function supports the following features:
Printing signed and unsigned integers.
Printing characters.
Printing null-terminated strings.
Printing octal and hexadecimal numbers.
Printing memory addresses.

# Limitations
The my_printf function does not support all the features and specifiers provided by the standard printf function in the C library.
The implementation may not handle edge cases or error conditions as robustly as the standard library function.
